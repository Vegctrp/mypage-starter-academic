My name is MIYAZAKI Keisuke (宮崎桂輔). I'm a corporate researcher in Fujitsu Limited. I got a master's degree in [Tokunaga-Lab](https://www.cl.c.titech.ac.jp/ja/start), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english).

I'm interested in natural language processing. Especially, I study topics including **neural machine translation** and **pretrained language models**.
